## Featured Projects

**The Recipe**  
This website is for all the baked good lovers; The purpose of the project was to create a well-structured HTML page, to which we later implemented CSS, it is a recipe for Banana Bread that can be made for breakfast, snacks, or on-the-go!

**Tribute Site**  
This website is a tribute to popular haute couture designer, Christian Dior; you will find a timeline of Christian Diors life from college to death, paired with Dior inspired typography, images, and texture. (This is a demostration of the basic understanding of HTML and CSS I had at the time.)
